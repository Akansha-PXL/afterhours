# afterhours ⭐🎧

**afterhours** is a chill, in-progress website where you can:
- listen to music like a radio (via playlists)
- vibe with a cute, pixel-style aesthetic
- eventually play small games
- doodle in a mini sketchbook
- (future plan) hang out with a simple chat feature
  
**Live site:**

## Current features
- Pixel-style typography  
- Auto-typing website title  
- Music-focused homepage
- More features will be added slowly 

This project is **very much a work in progress**.
